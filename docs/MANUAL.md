# About this manual

This is the complete reference for Akshar Devanagari IME: what it computes, how
it is trained, how it is measured, and how to reproduce every number in it.
It is written to be read start to finish by someone who has never seen the
codebase.

**Every quantitative claim here was measured on the tree it describes.** Where a
figure has not been re-measured since a change, the text says so rather than
carrying an older number forward. Where a component does not work, the manual
says that too --- Chapter 11 is a register of known defects, and the ablations in
Chapter 9 include the components that turned out to contribute nothing.

## Conventions

* Weights are **negative log probabilities** throughout. Lower is better, and
  costs add. This is the **tropical semiring** $(\min, +)$ [Mohri 1997], which is why
  decoding is a shortest-path problem.
* $R$ denotes a Roman-script input string, $D$ a Devanagari output string,
  $a$ an *akshara* (orthographic syllable), $s$ a Roman *chunk*.
* Accuracy figures are **top-1 exact string match** unless stated otherwise.
* `AK-Freq`, `AK-NEF`, `AK-NEI` are the three sources of the Aksharantar Nepali
  test split: frequent native words, and two named-entity sets.
* Code references are given as `path/to/file.rs`.

## Reproducing everything in this manual

```sh
make release        # build the engine
make test           # unit + integration tests, including the accuracy guard
make eval           # accuracy by split
make eval-full      # accuracy with bootstrap CIs and per-query latency
make eval-errors    # oracle curves, error taxonomy, CER, collision bound
```

Component ablations are switched at runtime; see §9.3.

# What this system is

Akshar is an input method engine that converts Roman-script typing into
Devanagari, targeted at Nepali. You type `namaste` and it offers `नमस्ते`.

Three properties define the design:

**No neural network at runtime.** The model is an EM-trained source-channel
model over orthographic syllables, a Kneser-Ney syllable language model, and a
linear discriminative reranker. Inference is beam search plus dot products.
There is no tensor library, no GPU, and no runtime dependency beyond the Rust
standard library and `serde`.

**Small enough to ship in a web page.** The desktop container is 11.37 MB; the
browser profile is 8.91 MB raw and 4.94 MB Brotli-compressed.

**Fast enough to run on every keystroke.** A suggestion query costs
**0.63--0.82 ms** on a desktop CPU with a beam width of 64 (§10).

## What it is not

It is not a general Indic transliteration system --- it is trained and measured
on Nepali only. It does not beat neural baselines on named entities (§9.2). And
it does not yet reach the 90% native accuracy that its error analysis shows is
attainable (§12).

## Measured performance

On the held-out AI4Bharat Aksharantar Nepali test split (4,101 cases), measured
2026-09-06 on `data/akshar.model` at default settings:

| Split | $n$ | top-1 | top-5 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `AK-Freq` (native words) | 2,108 | **81.83%** | 92.22% |
| `AK-NEI` (named entities) | 1,176 | 47.79% | 69.81% |
| `AK-NEF` (named entities) | 817 | 31.21% | 53.00% |
| All cases | 4,101 | 61.98% | 77.98% |

Bootstrap 95% CI on the pooled top-1 is [60.61%, 63.36%]; MRR is 0.6906.
Character error rate on `AK-Freq` top-1 is 3.90%.

For reference, **IndicXlit** (AI4Bharat; an ~11M-parameter transformer) reports
80.25% top-1 on the native split and 52.67% on named entities. Native accuracy
here is comparable; named-entity accuracy is substantially behind.

# Problem formulation

## The task

Given a Roman string $R$ typed by a user, produce a ranked list of Devanagari
strings $D$ that the user plausibly meant. This is *transliteration*, not
translation: the output should be the same word in a different script.

The difficulty is that Roman input for Devanagari is **not a code**. It is a
lossy, inconsistent, user-invented approximation:

* Vowel length is routinely dropped. `nepali` and `nepaalee` are both `नेपाली`.
* Retroflex/dental distinctions collapse. `t` may be `त` or `ट`.
* Aspiration is inconsistent. `kh` may be `ख`, but `k` sometimes is too.
* The inherent schwa is written or omitted at the user's discretion:
  `kamal`, `kamala`, and `kml` all target `कमल`.
* Conjuncts have no standard Roman form.

So the mapping is many-to-many in both directions, and the model must learn the
conventions from data rather than encode them by hand.

## The source-channel decomposition

Following Li, Zhang & Su (ACL 2004), *A Joint Source-Channel Model for Machine
Transliteration*, we model the user as a noisy channel: they have a Devanagari
word $D$ in mind and emit a Roman rendering $R$ of it. Then

$$
\hat{D} \;=\; \arg\max_{D} P(D \mid R)
      \;=\; \arg\max_{D} \underbrace{P(R \mid D)}_{\text{channel}} \cdot
                         \underbrace{P(D)}_{\text{source}} .
$$

The two factors are learned separately:

* $P(R \mid D)$ --- the **transliteration model**, learned by EM over an
  unaligned parallel lexicon (Chapter 5).
* $P(D)$ --- a **language model** over aksharas, smoothed with modified
  Kneser-Ney [Kneser & Ney 1995; Chen & Goodman 1999] (Chapter 6).

Working in negative logs, the decoder minimises

$$
\text{cost}(D) \;=\; \underbrace{-\log P(R \mid D)}_{\texttt{emit}}
                 \;+\; \lambda \cdot \underbrace{-\log P(D)}_{\texttt{lm}},
$$

with $\lambda$ (`DecoderConfig::lm_weight`, default 1.0) a tunable balance.
The two terms are accumulated **separately** all the way through decoding, because
the discriminative reranker (Chapter 7) consumes them as independent features.

## The unit of modelling: the akshara

Neither characters nor whole words are the right granularity.

Characters are wrong because Devanagari is an *abugida*: a consonant carries an
inherent vowel, and a matra (vowel sign) modifies the preceding consonant rather
than standing alone. The codepoint sequence `क` + `ि` is one pronounceable unit,
`कि`, and splitting it produces meaningless states.

Whole words are wrong because the vocabulary is open --- Nepali is agglutinative,
and compounds and case-marked forms are productive.

So the unit is the **akshara**, the orthographic syllable of Brahmic scripts.
The script class is Daniels' *abugida* [Daniels 1990]: a consonant carries an
inherent vowel that a diacritic overrides.

$$
\text{akshara} := (\text{consonant}\ \text{halanta})^{*}\ \text{consonant}?\
                  (\text{matra} \mid \text{independent-vowel})\
                  (\text{anusvara} \mid \text{visarga} \mid \text{chandrabindu} \mid \text{nukta})^{*}
$$

Implemented in `src/core/akshara.rs`. Examples:

| Word | Aksharas |
| :--- | :--- |
| `नमस्ते` | `न` `म` `स्ते` |
| `क्ष्त्र` | `क्ष्त्र` (one conjunct) |
| `अग` | `अ` `ग` |
| `काठमाडौँ` | `का` `ठ` `मा` `डौँ` |

A halanta (virama, `्`) glues the following consonant into the current akshara,
which is what makes conjuncts single units. Zero-width joiners are preserved
when attached to viramas, so Nepali eyelash-ra (`र्‍`) keeps its visual form.

The trained model has **16,556 aksharas** and **101,010 Roman chunks** before
pruning; after pruning to those reachable from the corpus vocabulary, 5,938
emission rows remain.

## Alignment is latent

The training data is a list of $(R, D)$ pairs with **no alignment** between
Roman substrings and aksharas. `kathmandu` / `काठमाडौँ` does not say that `kath`
corresponds to `का` `ठ`.

So the model treats the segmentation as a latent variable and sums over all of
them:

$$
P(R \mid D) \;=\; \sum_{\text{segmentations}\ s_1 \dots s_n \text{ of } R}\ \prod_{j=1}^{n} P(s_j \mid a_j),
$$

where $a_1 \dots a_n$ are the aksharas of $D$ and each $s_j$ is a contiguous
(possibly empty) chunk of Roman characters, of length at most
`MAX_CHUNK = 5`. This sum is computed exactly by dynamic programming, and EM
maximises it (Chapter 5).

\newpage

# The transliteration model and EM training

Implemented in `src/core/em_trainer.rs`, `src/core/alignment.rs`, and
`src/core/translit_model.rs`.

## Parameters

The model is a single table:

$$
\theta_{a,s} \;=\; P(s \mid a), \qquad \sum_{s} \theta_{a,s} = 1 \ \ \forall a,
$$

the probability that akshara $a$ is written as Roman chunk $s$. Chunks are
lowercase ASCII of length $0 \dots 5$; the empty chunk lets an akshara be
written as nothing at all, which is how the model handles dropped schwas.

Chunks are packed into a `u32` for allocation-free lookup: 5 bits per character
(26 letters plus an escape) in bits 0--24, and a 4-bit length in bits 26--29
(`translit_model.rs::pack_chunk_bytes`).

## Initialisation

EM is sensitive to its starting point, so emissions are seeded from a
deterministic codepoint aligner (`alignment.rs::align_emissive`) rather than
from a uniform distribution. For each pair, the aligner walks both strings and
assigns each akshara the Roman characters that plausibly correspond to it.

Bare consonants additionally seed two variants:

* the chunk plus `a` (the inherent schwa written out: `च` $\to$ `cha`), and
* the chunk minus a trailing `a` (the schwa dropped),

so that EM has both conventions available from the first iteration rather than
having to discover one from a distribution that assigns it zero mass.

Seed counts are normalised and floored at $10^{-4}$ so no observed chunk starts
with probability zero.

## The E-step: scaled forward-backward

For a pair with Roman length $m$ and $n$ aksharas, define

$$
\alpha_j(i) \;=\; P(\text{first } i \text{ Roman chars generated by first } j \text{ aksharas}),
$$
$$
\beta_j(i) \;=\; P(\text{Roman chars } i{+}1 \dots m \text{ generated by aksharas } j{+}1 \dots n).
$$

with the recurrences

$$
\alpha_j(i) = \sum_{l=0}^{\min(5,\,i)} \alpha_{j-1}(i-l)\;\theta_{a_j,\,R[i-l..i]},
\qquad
\beta_j(i) = \sum_{l=0}^{\min(5,\,m-i)} \theta_{a_{j+1},\,R[i..i+l]}\;\beta_{j+1}(i+l),
$$

$\alpha_0(0) = 1$, $\beta_n(m) = 1$. The total likelihood is $Z = \alpha_n(m)$,
and the expected count of $(a_j, s)$ at position $i$ is

$$
\gamma_j(i, l) \;=\; \frac{\alpha_{j-1}(i-l)\ \theta_{a_j,\,R[i-l..i]}\ \beta_j(i)}{Z}.
$$

### Why the passes are scaled

Computed naively, $Z$ underflows. A 12-akshara word whose emissions average
$0.05$ gives $Z \approx 2.4 \times 10^{-16}$. An earlier implementation guarded
this with `if z < 1e-12 { continue; }` --- a threshold 296 orders of magnitude
above the f64 subnormal limit --- which silently **discarded every long or
flat-emission word from training**, biasing EM toward short easy words.

The fix is the scaling of [Rabiner 1989, §V.A], developed there for HMM
forward-backward [Baum et al. 1970]. Each forward column is divided by its own
maximum $c_j$, and **the same factors** are divided out of the backward pass, so
that with

$$
F_j = \alpha_j \Big/ \prod_{t \le j} c_t, \qquad
B_j = \beta_j \Big/ \prod_{t > j} c_t,
$$

the scale products telescope and the posterior needs only a single per-column
correction:

$$
\gamma_j(i,l) \;=\; \frac{F_{j-1}(i-l)\ \theta\ B_j(i)}{c_j \cdot F_n(m)} .
$$

*Derivation:* $\alpha_{j-1} = F_{j-1} S_{j-1}$ and $\beta_j = B_j S_n / S_j$ with
$S_j = \prod_{t\le j} c_t$, and $Z = F_n(m) S_n$. Substituting, the $S$ factors
cancel to $1/c_j$ because $S_j = S_{j-1} c_j$. $\square$

This is verified by test, not by inspection: `scaled_forward_backward_matches_unscaled`
compares against an unscaled reference implementation,
`posteriors_sum_to_weight_per_akshara` checks that each akshara's posterior mass
equals its observation weight, and `long_low_probability_word_is_not_dropped`
pins the 12-akshara case the old floor discarded.

The E-step is embarrassingly parallel over pairs and runs on scoped threads.

## The M-step

Counts are normalised with Dirichlet smoothing toward the global chunk unigram
$u(s)$, so that a chunk seen with one akshara does not receive zero probability
under another:

$$
\theta_{a,s} \;\leftarrow\; \frac{\text{count}(a,s) \;+\; \alpha\, u(s)}{\sum_{s'} \text{count}(a,s') \;+\; \alpha},
\qquad \alpha = 0.05 .
$$

Twelve iterations are run by default. EM over all 3,588,793 pairs takes about
170 s on a desktop CPU.

## What the model looks like when trained

Emissions are stored as `Vec<Vec<(chunk_id, -log P)>>`, one row per akshara,
each row **sorted ascending by chunk id**. That ordering is not incidental: the
container delta-encodes the ids (§8.2) and the runtime binary-searches them
(§10.2), and both would be incorrect for any other order.

\newpage

# The language model

Implemented in `em_trainer.rs::build_kn_lm` and consumed by
`translit_model.rs`. This is an akshara $n$-gram model, and it is **the largest
single contributor to accuracy** in the system: removing the trigram order costs
3.89pp of native top-1 (§9.1).

## Why Kneser-Ney

Maximum-likelihood $n$-gram estimates assign zero to unseen contexts, and
add-$\alpha$ smoothing is badly wrong on large alphabets --- with 16,556
aksharas, a single observation under add-1 would imply $P \approx 0.67$.

Kneser-Ney addresses a subtler problem. The right lower-order estimate is not
"how often did this akshara occur" but "**in how many distinct contexts** did it
occur". An akshara that appears constantly but always after the same predecessor
(the *Kong* in *Hong Kong*) is a poor bet in a novel context. The continuation
probability captures exactly that:

$$
P_{\text{cont}}(b) \;=\; \frac{\bigl|\{a : c(a,b) > 0\}\bigr| \;+\; 0.5}
                              {\bigl|\{(a,b) : c(a,b) > 0\}\bigr| \;+\; 0.5N},
$$

with the $+0.5$ floor keeping the log finite for aksharas that only ever appear
word-initially. $N$ is the akshara vocabulary size.

## Modified Kneser-Ney discounts

A single absolute discount $\delta$ [Ney, Essen & Kneser 1994] over-discounts frequent $n$-grams and
under-discounts singletons. Chen & Goodman (1999) use three discounts, chosen by
the count of the $n$-gram, estimated from the counts-of-counts $n_1 \dots n_4$:

$$
Y = \frac{n_1}{n_1 + 2n_2}, \qquad
D_1 = 1 - 2Y\frac{n_2}{n_1}, \qquad
D_2 = 2 - 3Y\frac{n_3}{n_2}, \qquad
D_3 = 3 - 4Y\frac{n_4}{n_3},
$$

subject to $0 \le D_i \le i$. That constraint matters. An earlier implementation
clamped all three to $\le 0.9/0.9/0.95$; the values this corpus actually produces
are

| order | $D_1$ | $D_2$ | $D_3$ |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| bigram | 0.6049 | 1.0362 | 1.4443 |
| trigram | 0.6696 | 1.0949 | 1.4330 |

so $D_2$ was being cut by 13% and $D_3$ by 34%, both pinned at the ceiling. The
effect was to collapse modified Kneser-Ney back into single-discount absolute
discounting at $d \approx 0.9$ --- *worse* than the fixed $0.75$ it replaced.
The bounds are now correct. See §9.4 for what fixing them was worth.

If $n_1$, $n_2$ or $n_3$ is zero the estimator is degenerate and the model falls
back to fixed $(0.5, 0.75, 0.95)$.

## The interpolated model

For a bigram context $a$ with total count $c(a) = \sum_b c(a,b)$:

$$
P(b \mid a) \;=\; \frac{\max\bigl(c(a,b) - D_{c(a,b)},\ 0\bigr)}{c(a)}
             \;+\; \lambda(a)\, P_{\text{cont}}(b),
\qquad
\lambda(a) = \frac{\sum_b D_{c(a,b)}}{c(a)} .
$$

$\lambda(a)$ is exactly the mass removed by discounting, so the distribution
sums to one. The trigram has the same form with context $(a,b)$ and $c(a,b)$ as
the denominator, backing off to the bigram.

A **word-start prior** is estimated separately from word-initial counts:

$$
P(a \mid \#) = \frac{c_{\#}(a) + 0.5}{W + 0.5N}, \qquad W = \text{corpus word count}.
$$

## Storage and lookup

All quantities are stored as $-\log$ weights in `f32`. Per context the model
stores the seen successors and one backoff weight $-\log \lambda$; an unseen
successor costs $-\log\lambda + (-\log P_{\text{lower}})$, which reconstructs the
interpolated value exactly. `trigram_weight` falls back to `bigram_weight`, which
falls back to `unigram_kn`.

Successor rows are sorted ascending by id and looked up by **binary search**.
This is not a micro-optimisation: the beam performs roughly 50,000 LM lookups per
query, and when these rows were scanned linearly they accounted for most of the
engine's runtime (§10.2).

## Two known deviations from textbook KN

Both are recorded here rather than hidden, and both are open (§11):

1. **The trigram interpolates against the highest-order bigram**, not the
   continuation estimate $N_{1+}(\bullet, b, c)$ that Kneser-Ney requires. The
   bigram$\to$unigram step is correct; the trigram$\to$bigram step is not.
2. **There is no end-of-word symbol.** The model has a word-start prior but no
   `</w>`, so trigram mass is deficient by exactly the word-final fraction, and
   the model cannot express that a given akshara is an implausible way to end a
   word. Since 51.9% of native top-1 errors are matra-only and matra errors
   concentrate word-finally, this is a real gap and not merely a formal one.

\newpage

# Decoding

Implemented in `src/core/decoder.rs`.

## The lattice

Decoding is a shortest-path search over a lattice built on the Roman string.
Nodes are character positions $0 \dots m$. An edge from position $p$ to $p + l$
is labelled with an akshara $a$ that can emit the chunk $R[p..p{+}l]$, and
carries weight $-\log P(R[p..p{+}l] \mid a)$.

Edges come from a **reverse index** built once at load time: chunk $\to$ list of
$(akshara, weight)$, sorted by weight and truncated. Two caps keep the lattice
tractable:

* `max_emission_weight = 8.0` --- emissions worse than $e^{-8}$ are alignment
  noise and are dropped.
* `max_aksharas_per_chunk = 16` --- at most 16 aksharas compete for any chunk.

A path from $0$ to $m$ spells one candidate Devanagari string; its cost is the
sum of edge weights plus the LM cost of its akshara sequence.

## Beam search

The search is a **beam search** [Lowerre 1976], step-synchronous over aksharas. Each step expands every beam state
across every edge available at its position, scores the extension, and keeps the
best `beam_width` hypotheses (default 64, `AKSHAR_BEAM`).

A state carries its position, its previous two aksharas (the trigram context), the
running `emit` and `lm` costs **separately**, a path hash, and an index into a
persistent path arena. Extending a path is $O(1)$: one arena cell holding
`(parent, akshara)`. Reconstruction walks parents backwards at the end.

Three properties of this loop are deliberate and worth stating, because each
looks like an oversight:

**Distinct paths are not merged by state.** A conventional Viterbi beam would
collapse hypotheses sharing `(pos, prev2, prev)` and keep the best. This decoder
extracts *k-best paths*, not the 1-best path per state, so merging would destroy
the diversity the reranker needs. An earlier version keyed a merge map on
`(pos, prev2, prev, path_hash)`, which could only ever merge on a hash collision
--- it built and tore down a hash map every step to do nothing, and was removed.

**Pruning uses `select_nth_unstable_by`, not a sort.** Keeping the best 64 of
~5,000 hypotheses does not require ordering them; the beam's internal order is
never read. This is $O(n)$ instead of $O(n \log n)$.

**Arena cells are materialised only for survivors.** Hypotheses are generated
into a lightweight `Cand` struct holding the parent index and its own akshara;
only after pruning are the survivors written into the arena. This cuts arena
writes from $O(\text{beam} \times \text{edges})$ to $O(\text{beam})$ per step.

Completed paths (those reaching position $m$) are collected into a map keyed by
the output string, keeping the best cost per string, and sorted once at the end.

## Two passes: free and trie-constrained

`decode_union` runs the beam **twice** and merges:

1. **Free decode** (`decode_detailed`) --- the full lattice. Can produce any
   akshara sequence, including words that do not exist. This is what handles
   novel compounds and out-of-vocabulary names.
2. **Trie-constrained decode** (`decode_in_words_detailed`) --- the lattice
   intersected with a word trie built from the corpus vocabulary. Every edge
   must extend a valid word prefix, and only trie terminals are returned.

The second pass is far cheaper (0.12 ms against 0.55 ms) because most akshara
sequences are not word prefixes, so its beam collapses almost immediately. It is
also strictly a recall addition: it surfaces real words the free beam ranked
outside its top 50.

Its contribution is +0.66pp top-1 and +1.14pp top-5 (§9.1). Running *only* the
trie pass would be 4x faster still, but costs 15.65pp of native top-1 --- the
vocabulary simply does not cover the test set --- so both passes stay.

## What the decoder returns

A `DecodedCandidate` per output string, carrying `emit`, `lm` and
`akshara_count` **separately** rather than as one summed score, because the
reranker uses them as independent features.

\newpage

# Discriminative reranking

Implemented in `src/core/reranker.rs`, weights in `reranker_weights.rs`.

The decoder's generative score is not the last word. It knows nothing about how
common a word is, what shape Nepali words have, or how the language's morphology
works. The reranker re-scores the decoder's top candidates using features the
generative model cannot express.

## The baseline heuristic

Before any learned model, candidates are scored by a three-parameter heuristic:

$$
h(D) \;=\; \texttt{emit} \;+\; 0.85 \cdot \texttt{lm} \;-\; 0.75 \cdot \log(1 + f(D)),
$$

where $f(D)$ is the corpus frequency of $D$. This alone achieves **81.02%**
native top-1 --- it is a strong baseline, and the learned model must be measured
against it, not against nothing.

## Dense features

29 features per candidate (`extract_dense_features`):

| Index | Feature |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0--1 | `emit`, `lm` from the decoder |
| 2 | akshara count |
| 3 | decoder rank |
| 4--5 | heuristic score, heuristic rank |
| 6--8 | $\log(1+f)$, frequency-rank percentile, in-vocabulary indicator |
| 9 | output length in characters |
| 10 | total matra count |
| 11--20 | per-matra counts (10 matras) |
| 21--23 | nasals, visarga, halants |
| 24--26 | vowel-initial, ends-in-matra, ends-in-nasal/visarga |
| 27 | Roman input length |
| 28 | morphology-aware effective log frequency |

Feature 28 deserves a note. Nepali is agglutinative, so an inflected form may be
absent from the corpus while its stem is frequent. `morph_effective_log_freq`
strips one of 34 known suffixes (`को`, `हरू`, `लाई`, `एको`, ...) and, if the stem
has frequency $\ge 5$, returns $\log f(\text{stem}) + 3.5$. This gives unseen but
well-formed inflections a frequency prior instead of zero.

Features are standardised before scoring:

$$
\text{score}_{\text{dense}}(D) \;=\; \sum_{k=0}^{28} w_k \cdot \frac{\phi_k(D) - \mu_k}{\sigma_k}.
$$

**$\mu$ and $\sigma$ travel with the model**, in the v5 container. They used to be
compiled-in constants that no training stage refreshed --- and since retraining
the EM/LM shifts the `emit` and `lm` distributions (a 100k retrain moved `lm`
from $\mu = 21.83, \sigma = 5.74$ to $24.64, 7.03$), the weights were being
applied to differently-scaled inputs with nothing to detect it. Containers older
than v5 fall back to the constants.

## Sparse lexicalized features

Seven templates are hashed into a $2^{20}$-slot table of `i8` weights --- the
**hashing trick** [Weinberger et al. 2009], which trades hash collisions for a
fixed memory budget over an unbounded feature space:

1. length-delta bucket (aksharas minus Roman characters)
2. final akshara $\times$ final Roman character
3. first akshara $\times$ first Roman character
4. matra $\times$ preceding consonant
5. morphological suffix $\times$ Roman tail character
6. final matra $\times$ final Roman character
7. penultimate consonant $\times$ final matra

Weights are quantised to `i8` with the scale set from the 99.9th percentile of
non-zero magnitudes and explicit clipping --- not from the single largest weight,
which previously let one outlier compress every other weight into a handful of
levels.

## The blend

$$
\text{score}(D) \;=\; (1-\gamma)\cdot\bigl(-z(h(D))\bigr) \;+\; \gamma \cdot z\bigl(\text{score}_{\text{dense+sparse}}(D)\bigr),
\qquad \gamma = 0.3,
$$

where $z(\cdot)$ standardises within the candidate list. $\gamma$ was tuned, and
is worth understanding honestly:

| $\gamma$ | meaning | `AK-Freq` top-1 |
| ---: | :--- | ---: |
| 0.0 | heuristic only, learned model unused | 81.02% |
| **0.3** | **shipped** | **81.83%** |
| 0.6 | | 81.31% |
| 1.0 | learned model only | 76.47% |

**The learned model used alone is 5.36pp worse than the three-parameter
heuristic.** $\gamma = 0.3$ is not a cautious discount of a good model; it is the
blend point at which a weak model stops doing damage.

The cause is identified in §12.3: `W_DENSE` has never been retrained by this
pipeline. It is a frozen constant, and the generator named in its header does
not exist in the repository. Training more sparse capacity on top of misfitted
dense weights was tested at 5x the data and did not help.

## The cascade

Full feature extraction --- akshara segmentation, matra scans, sparse hashing ---
is far more expensive than the heuristic, and candidates the heuristic already
ranks far down never reach the top of the final list. Only the top
`AKSHAR_RERANK_DEPTH` (default 24) by heuristic rank are fully scored; the rest
keep heuristic order below the scored block.

Measured on `AK-Freq`: depth 24 gives 81.83/92.22, depth 50 (no cascade) gives
81.69/92.22, depth 12 gives 81.78/92.41, depth 6 gives 81.31/91.98. The effect
is within noise down to depth 12.

One subtlety is documented in the source: the synthetic scores given to unscored
candidates participate in the $\gamma$ z-blend, so the blend weight moves
slightly with the scored/unscored ratio. Ordering among scored candidates is
unaffected (z-scoring is affine).

# The engine: candidate fusion and learning

Implemented in `src/core/engine.rs`.

## Sources of evidence

The engine merges candidates from several sources into one ranked list, taking
the **maximum** evidence per output string:

| Source | Score | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Decoder + reranker | $800{,}000 / (1 + \text{cost})$ | cost is the reranker margin below the best |
| User-confirmed trie | $900{,}000 + \text{freq}$ | prefix match on learned words |
| User fuzzy (SymSpell) | $50{,}000 - 12{,}000 \cdot d$ | distance-verified, learned words only |
| Context re-rank | multiplicative | user bigrams |

**This score space is the weakest part of the architecture, and this manual does
not pretend otherwise.** The bands are hand-tuned `u64` constants compared
against a hyperbolically squashed reranker score, and two of the three serious
defects found in this system came from that design:

* A corpus-wide fuzzy source scored at $850{,}000$ --- above the decoder band ---
  so any fuzzy hit displaced the reranker's top-1. It cost **30.8pp** of native
  top-1 and, when tested fairly, contributed no recall at any band. It was
  removed.
* The user fuzzy band, at $38{,}000$ for a distance-1 match, sits *below* the
  decoder's eighth-ranked candidate (~250,000). A word the user has confirmed
  cannot be recovered from a typo. The path is structurally unreachable
  (defect D18, §11).

The correct fix for both is not a better constant but a single log-linear score
in which every source contributes a *feature* rather than occupying a band. That
work is §12.

## Digits and punctuation

Digits map to Devanagari numerals (`123` $\to$ `१२३`) and a trailing `.` offers
purnabiram (`namaste.` $\to$ `नमस्ते।`). These are handled directly, before the
statistical path.

## Adaptive learning

`user_confirms(roman, devanagari)` records the user's choice into:

* the **trie** [Fredkin 1960] (`src/core/trie.rs`) --- prefix lookup with frequency;
* the **SymSpell index** (`src/fuzzy/symspell.rs`) --- delete-variant map for
  typo tolerance;
* the **context model** (`src/core/context.rs`) --- user bigrams for
  re-ranking by preceding word.

Learned state is separate from the model and persists via
`src/persistence.rs` (desktop) or `export_state`/`import_state` (browser).

### How fuzzy matching actually behaves

Two mechanisms remain, and they are different in kind:

1. **Query-variant rewriting** (`src/core/normalizer.rs`) --- a Dijkstra search
   over a small rewrite transducer (`ee`$\to$`ii`, `oo`$\to$`uu`, `w`$\to$`v`,
   separator removal), each rule carrying a cost. Cold-start: needs no learning.
   Measured contribution on the benchmark: **0.00pp**, because only the first
   variant is ever decoded and the EM emissions already absorb these
   alternations.
2. **User SymSpell** --- symmetric-delete matching [Garbe] over confirmed words. Every
   hit is verified with bounded Damerau-Levenshtein before scoring, because a
   delete-set intersection is a *necessary* condition only: at
   `max_edit_distance = 1` it still returns pairs at true distance 2.

Behaviour is pinned by `tests/fuzzy_behavior.rs`.

\newpage

# The model container

Implemented in `src/core/unified.rs` and `src/core/codec.rs`.

## One file

The engine loads exactly one artefact, `data/akshar.model`. It holds:

* the transliteration model (aksharas, chunks, emissions),
* the Kneser-Ney LM (unigram continuation, bigrams, trigrams, backoffs,
  word-start prior),
* the corpus vocabulary with frequencies,
* the sparse reranker table and its dequantisation scale,
* the dense-feature normalisation statistics ($\mu$, $\sigma$).

## Versions

| Version | Change |
| ---: | :--- |
| v1 | initial layout |
| v2 | adds `sparse_scale` |
| v3 | compact codec: CSR adjacency, delta varints, 8-bit codebooks |
| v4 | removes the word-bigram table (19.5 MB for +0.16pp) |
| **v5** | carries the reranker's dense normalisation statistics |

`save` writes v5; v1--v4 still load, with older containers falling back to the
compiled-in normalisation constants. bincode is positional and not
self-describing, so each version has its own struct and the reader dispatches on
a version peeked from the header --- appending a field to an existing struct
would silently corrupt every file already written with it.

## Compact encoding

Naive bincode of these structures is 66.59 MB. Four techniques bring it to
11.37 MB with no accuracy change:

* **CSR adjacency with delta varints.** Successor ids within a row are ascending,
  so only the gaps are stored, as variable-length integers. (This is also why the
  rows must stay sorted --- see §5.5 and §10.2.)
* **8-bit weight codebooks.** Each numeric section gets a 256-entry codebook of
  `f32` values; entries store an index. Weights cluster tightly, so the
  quantisation error is far below the model's discrimination threshold.
* **Front-coded vocabulary** (a standard dictionary compression, as in
  [Witten, Moffat & Bell 1999]). Words are stored as akshara-id sequences against a
  shared prefix.
* **Packed chunk strings.**

Section sizes can be inspected at any time:

```sh
cargo run --release --bin probe_model -- data/akshar.model --inspect
```

## Browser profile

`make web-model` produces `data/akshar_wasm.model` by relative-entropy pruning
of the trigram LM [Stolcke 1998]. `TRIGRAM_THRESHOLD` (default `3e-2`) trades size against
accuracy along a measured curve; at the default it keeps 47% of trigram
transitions and yields 8.91 MB raw, 4.94 MB Brotli.

\newpage

# Training

Implemented in `src/bin/train/train.rs`. One command produces the container:

```sh
make train-quick    # reranker on 100k pairs,  ~10 min
make train-mid      # reranker on 500k pairs,  ~40 min   <- validation gate
make train-full     # reranker on all 3.59M,   ~4 h
```

## What `--reranker-pairs` does and does not control

**It sizes the reranker's training set only.** The EM emission model, the
Kneser-Ney LM and the corpus vocabulary always consume the full data regardless
of which target is run:

| Component | Data used, every run |
| :--- | :--- |
| EM emissions + KN LM | all 3,588,793 parallel pairs |
| Vocabulary | 470,012 words from a 1.5 GB corpus (hapax pruned at $f < 3$) |
| Reranker sparse table | `--reranker-pairs` |

This matters when interpreting a quick run: it exercises the EM and LM changes
at full scale, but not the reranker's batching.

## The four phases

**Phase 1 --- EM.** Ingest pairs, seed emissions from the aligner, run 12 EM
iterations, build the Kneser-Ney LM. ~170 s.

**Phase 2 --- Vocabulary.** Stream the running-text corpus, count word
frequencies, prune below $f = 3$. ~33 s.

**Phase 3 --- Reranker.** Decode each training pair, extract dense and sparse
features, and train the sparse table by softmax cross-entropy over the candidate
list with **AdaGrad** [Duchi, Hazan & Singer 2011]. The objective is
candidate reranking in the sense of [Collins 2000]. Above 200,000 pairs this runs **chunked**: batches of 100,000
are decoded once and reused for all epochs, which is why a full run is ~4 h
rather than ~18 h.

**Phase 4 --- Pack.** Prune emission rows unreachable from the vocabulary,
quantise the sparse table, and write the v5 container.

## Learning rate

AdaGrad adapts per slot, so the global schedule only needs a gentle anneal:
`lr` starts at 0.05 and decays to 10% of that across the whole run, spread evenly
over the batches.

This replaced a schedule that compounded `0.8^(epochs-1)` *per batch* on top of a
per-batch `0.995` --- a factor of 0.6368 per batch, reaching
$4.4 \times 10^{-9}$ by batch 36. A `train-full` run under that schedule trained
effectively on the first ~500k pairs and no-opped the remaining ~3M, which is why
adding data had never helped.

## Held-out monitoring

4,000 pairs are held out from the tail of the corpus, decoded once, and scored
after every batch (chunked) or epoch (non-chunked). The table written into the
container is the **best by dev loss**, not necessarily the last.

This is not optional hygiene. The sparse table has ~$10^6$ parameters and no
regularisation, so overfitting is the default failure mode --- and before this,
only training loss was reported, which cannot distinguish learning from
memorisation.

Watch for: dev loss falling monotonically, and the final learning rate within an
order of magnitude of the first.

> **Caution.** `train` writes `data/akshar.model` unless `--out` is given, so a
> training run silently replaces the released container. Back it up, or always
> pass `--out`, before experimenting.

## Data

| Artefact | Contents |
| :--- | :--- |
| `data/aksharantar/train_devanagari.jsonl` | 3.59M Roman/Devanagari pairs |
| `data/aksharantar/valid_devanagari.jsonl` | held-out validation split |

| `data/store/corpus_clean.txt` | 1.5 GB Nepali running text |
| `data/eval/test_multiref.jsonl` | 14,410 loose romanizations of the test set |

Held-out text never contributes to vocabulary counts or the EM model.

# Evaluation methodology

This chapter states what is measured, how, and under what assumptions, so that
every number elsewhere in the manual can be checked or contested.

## Data

**Benchmark.** The AI4Bharat *Aksharantar* Nepali collection
[Madhani et al. 2023], a public corpus of Roman/Devanagari word pairs.

| Split | Pairs | Use |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| `train_devanagari.jsonl` | 3,588,793 | EM, language model, reranker |
| `valid_devanagari.jsonl` | 852 KB | held out; available, currently unused by the reranker |
| `test_devanagari.jsonl` | 4,101 | **all reported accuracy** |

The test split carries a `source` field partitioning it into three strata,
reported separately throughout because they behave very differently:

| Stratum | $n$ | Content |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| `AK-Freq` | 2,108 | frequent native Nepali words |
| `AK-NEI` | 1,176 | named entities, Indic-origin |
| `AK-NEF` | 817 | named entities, foreign-origin |

`AK-Freq` is treated as the headline metric because it measures the intended
task --- typing ordinary Nepali. Named-entity strata are reported alongside and
never pooled into a single "accuracy" without saying so.

**Vocabulary and language-model text** come from a separate 1.5 GB Nepali
running-text corpus (`data/store/corpus_clean.txt`), pruned at frequency $< 3$
to 470,012 types.

**Contamination control.** Held-out text does not contribute to vocabulary
counts, the EM model, or the language model. The engine is constructed fresh per
evaluation run with an **empty user dictionary**: the adaptive-learning path
(§7.3) is not exercised, because feeding it gold answers during evaluation would
make every later occurrence trivially correct. `evaluate_aksharantar` therefore
calls `get_suggestions` only, never `user_confirms`.

## Metrics

Let $N$ be the number of test cases, $D_i^{*}$ the gold Devanagari string for
case $i$, and $\hat{D}_i^{(1)}, \dots, \hat{D}_i^{(k)}$ the engine's ranked
output.

**Top-$k$ accuracy.** Exact string match, the primary metric:

$$
\mathrm{Acc}@k \;=\; \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\ \mathbb{1}\!\left[\, D_i^{*} \in \{\hat{D}_i^{(1)},\dots,\hat{D}_i^{(k)}\}\,\right].
$$

Exact match is strict --- a single wrong matra scores zero --- and it is the
right metric for an IME, where the user either gets the word or has to fix it.
$k = 1$ measures the top suggestion; $k = 5$ approximates a visible candidate
bar. Comparison is on NFC-normalised Unicode strings with no case folding.

**Mean reciprocal rank.** Sensitive to *where* in the list the answer falls,
not just whether it is present:

$$
\mathrm{MRR} \;=\; \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{\mathrm{rank}_i},
\qquad \mathrm{rank}_i = \min\{\,j : \hat{D}_i^{(j)} = D_i^{*}\,\},
$$

with $1/\mathrm{rank}_i = 0$ when the gold answer is absent from the returned
list.

**Character error rate.** A graded measure, so that near-misses are
distinguished from nonsense:

$$
\mathrm{CER} \;=\; \frac{\sum_{i} \mathrm{lev}\!\left(\hat{D}_i^{(1)}, D_i^{*}\right)}{\sum_{i} \left|D_i^{*}\right|},
$$

with $\mathrm{lev}$ the Levenshtein distance [Levenshtein 1966] over Unicode
scalar values.

**Oracle@$k$.** The accuracy a *perfect* reranker would achieve on the
candidate list actually generated:

$$
\mathrm{Oracle}@k \;=\; \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbb{1}\!\left[\,D_i^{*} \in \mathrm{Cand}_i^{(k)}\,\right].
$$

This separates the two failure modes that a single accuracy number confounds:
$\mathrm{Oracle}@k - \mathrm{Acc}@1$ is **ranking** loss (generated, mis-ordered),
and $1 - \mathrm{Oracle}@k$ is **generation** loss (never produced at all). The
distinction drives the entire roadmap (§13).

**Multi-reference accuracy.** Roman input is ambiguous, so a prediction can be
correct without matching the single reference. `data/eval/test_multiref.jsonl`
collects 14,410 alternative romanizations; scoring credits a match against any
reference for the same input. Reported alongside strict accuracy, never instead
of it.

## Protocol

**Configuration.** Unless stated otherwise: beam width 64, rerank cascade depth
24, $\gamma = 0.3$, $k = 5$ requested, `data/akshar.model`, no user dictionary,
single desktop CPU. Every ablation varies exactly one factor via a documented
environment switch (§9.3) against this fixed baseline.

**Determinism.** The engine is deterministic --- no sampling, no RNG on the
inference path, and hash containers on the ordering path use a fixed-seed hasher.
Repeated runs of `evaluate_aksharantar` reproduce identical counts. Reported
figures are therefore single runs, not averages, and any difference between two
runs is a real difference in code, model or configuration.

**Latency.** Wall-clock per `get_suggestions` call, averaged over all 4,101
cases after model load, measured inside the harness rather than by timing the
process (which would include a ~1.5 s cold start). Latency is reported to three
decimal places in ms but should be read as $\pm$ 10%: it is sensitive to machine
load, and several figures in this manual were taken while a training job was
running --- those are marked where they appear.

## Statistical treatment

**Confidence intervals.** `evaluate` reports bootstrap percentile intervals
[Efron 1979]: resample the $N$ per-case outcomes with replacement $B$ times
($B = 1000$ by default, seed 42), recompute the statistic on each resample, and
take the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.

**Comparing two configurations.** Independent confidence intervals are the
*wrong* tool here: both systems see the same cases, so their errors are
correlated and overlapping intervals do not imply no difference. Comparisons use
**McNemar's test** [McNemar 1947] on the paired outcomes. With

$$
b_{01} = \#\{i : \text{A wrong},\ \text{B right}\}, \qquad
b_{10} = \#\{i : \text{A right},\ \text{B wrong}\},
$$

the concordant cases carry no information about which system is better, and
under $H_0$ the discordant ones split evenly. The two-sided exact $p$-value is

$$
p \;=\; 2 \sum_{i=0}^{\min(b_{01},\,b_{10})} \binom{n}{i} \Big/ 2^{\,n},
\qquad n = b_{01} + b_{10},
$$

clipped at 1. Both $b_{01}$ and $b_{10}$ are reported with every comparison, not
just $p$, because their magnitudes show whether a change is a small net effect
over many disagreements or a genuinely consistent one.

Significance is claimed at $\alpha = 0.05$. **No correction is applied for
multiple comparisons**, so the ablation table's borderline entries
($0.01 < p < 0.05$) should be read as suggestive rather than established.

**Effect sizes.** Reported in percentage points on the relevant stratum. One
standard error on `AK-Freq` at $n = 2{,}108$ and $p \approx 0.82$ is
$\sqrt{p(1-p)/n} \approx 0.84$pp, which is the yardstick used throughout for
calling a difference "within noise".

## Threats to validity

Stated so a reader can weigh the results rather than take them on trust.

**Single benchmark.** All accuracy comes from one test set of one language. The
Dakshina benchmark [Roark et al. 2020], on which the IndicXlit comparison
figures are usually quoted, is not evaluated here.

**Baseline comparability.** IndicXlit numbers (80.25% native, 52.67%
named-entity top-1) are quoted from [Madhani et al. 2023], **not re-measured**
in this environment. They are cited for scale, and no claim of a controlled
head-to-head is made.

**Isolated words.** The headline metric scores words with no sentence context,
which is not how an IME is used. `evaluate_sentences` measures in-context
accuracy on held-out running text and is the more realistic figure; it is
reported less often here simply because it has changed less.

**Vocabulary overlap.** The frequency prior is built from a news-domain corpus
and the test set is drawn from a related distribution, so the prior's
contribution (+5.64pp, §9.1) may not transfer to out-of-domain input.

**Tuning on the test set.** $\gamma$, beam width and cascade depth were selected
by sweeping against this test split. Those choices are mildly optimistic; the
validation split exists and should be used for them.

## Harnesses

| Command | Reports |
| :--- | :--- |
| `make eval` | top-1/top-5 per stratum |
| `make eval-full` | bootstrap CIs, MRR, latency |
| `make eval-errors` | oracle curves, error taxonomy, CER, collision bound |
| `make ablate` | per-component contribution |
| `cargo test --release` | unit tests plus the accuracy regression guard |

## The accuracy regression guard

`tests/accuracy_regression.rs` evaluates a 400-case `AK-Freq` sample on every
`cargo test`, failing below 76% top-1 or 88% top-5.

It exists because a **30.79pp regression once shipped through 92 green unit
tests**. Every component was individually correct; their *composition* was
wrong. No amount of unit testing detects that.

## Headroom, and where the errors are

From `make eval-errors` at beam 256:

| | `AK-Freq` | All |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| engine top-1 (strict / multi-ref) | 81.83% / 82.16% | 61.89% / 62.23% |
| decoder oracle @2 | **89.8%** | 71.4% |
| decoder oracle @5 | 92.4% | 78.1% |
| decoder oracle @50 | **94.3%** | 85.1% |
| matra-only share of misses | **51.9%** | 37.2% |
| top-1 if the matra class were solved | **91.03%** | 76.08% |
| CER (engine top-1) | 3.90% | 11.66% |

Three consequences, which set the roadmap:

1. **The gap is ranking, not generation.** The gold answer is in the decoder's
   top 50 for 94.3% of native cases but ranked first for 81.8%. 12.5pp are
   generated and then mis-ranked.
2. **Most of that is a binary decision.** Oracle@2 is 89.8%, so 8.0 of the 12.5
   points are a choice between the top two candidates.
3. **Half the errors are vowel signs.** 51.9% of native misses are *matra-only*:
   prediction and gold agree after stripping vowel-length and nasal marks.

An error is classified *matra-only* if prediction and gold become identical
after deleting all matras, anusvara, visarga and chandrabindu; *halant-only* by
the same construction on viramas; and *substantive* otherwise.

## The collision bound

`analyze_errors` computes the ceiling for **any** string-only system whose sole
prior is corpus unigram frequency. Let $A(R)$ be the set of Devanagari words
observed for Roman input $R$ across train, valid and test, and $f$ the corpus
frequency:

$$
\mathrm{Acc}^{*} \;=\; \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbb{1}\!\left[\, D_i^{*} = \arg\max_{D \in A(R_i)} f(D)\,\right] \;=\; 99.15\%.
$$

Only 0.85% of cases are unwinnable this way (1.6% of Roman inputs map to more
than one gold form). **The dataset is not the constraint**, and a 90% target is
not near any intrinsic ceiling.

\newpage

# Ablations: what each component is worth

Every component here can be switched off at runtime, so this table is
reproducible from the shipped binary rather than from patched builds.

## Switches

| Variable | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| `AKSHAR_NO_TRIE_UNION=1` | skip the trie-constrained decode pass |
| `AKSHAR_TRIE_ONLY=1` | skip the free lattice beam |
| `AKSHAR_NO_SPARSE=1` | drop the $2^{20}$ sparse reranker table |
| `AKSHAR_NO_RERANK=1` | rank by raw decoder score, skipping the rerank stage |
| `AKSHAR_GAMMA=<f>` | override the dense/heuristic blend |
| `AKSHAR_NO_TRIGRAM=1` | force the LM to back off to bigrams |
| `AKSHAR_NO_VARIANTS=1` | decode the raw query only |
| `AKSHAR_BEAM=<n>` | beam width (default 64) |
| `AKSHAR_RERANK_DEPTH=<n>` | cascade depth (default 24) |

## The rerank stage, built up from raw decoder order

An earlier version of this table treated $\gamma = 0$ as "no reranking". That
was wrong: $\gamma = 0$ still applies the frequency heuristic, which *is* part of
the rerank stage. Building the stage up from the generative ranking gives the
honest decomposition:

| Ranking | `AK-Freq` top-1 | $\Delta$ |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| raw decoder order (`emit + lm`) | 75.38% | --- |
| $+$ frequency heuristic ($\gamma = 0$) | 81.02% | **+5.64** |
| $+$ 29 dense features | 81.93% | +0.91 |
| $+$ $2^{20}$ sparse table (shipped) | 81.83% | −0.10 |

**Reranking is worth +6.45pp overall** --- the second-largest contribution in
the system after the trigram LM. But **87% of that value is the
three-parameter heuristic**

$$h(D) = \texttt{emit} + 0.85\,\texttt{lm} - 0.75\log(1 + f(D)),$$

whose entire content is a corpus frequency prior the generative model does not
have. The $10^6$-parameter learned stage adds +0.91pp on top of it, and the
sparse half of that contributes nothing on native words (§9.2).

Reproduce with `AKSHAR_NO_RERANK=1`, `AKSHAR_GAMMA=0.0`, `AKSHAR_NO_SPARSE=1`.

## Contribution of each remaining component

Full system: **81.83%** on `AK-Freq`.

| Component removed | top-1 | $\Delta$ |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| whole rerank stage | 75.38% | **−6.45** |
| trigram LM (bigram only) | 77.94% | **−3.89** |
| dense + sparse (heuristic only) | 81.02% | −0.81 |

| query variants | 81.83% | 0.00 |

The **language model and the frequency prior carry this system.** Everything
learned discriminatively is marginal by comparison.

## Paired significance

Marginal deltas are not evidence on their own. McNemar's test on paired outcomes:

**Removing the sparse table** (~$10^6$ parameters, 1.00 MB, 8.8% of the container):

| Split | $n$ | full | ablated | $\Delta$ | w$\to$r | r$\to$w | $p$ |
| :--- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| AK-Freq | 2108 | 81.83% | 81.93% | +0.09 | 15 | 13 | 0.851 |
| AK-NEF | 817 | 31.21% | 29.38% | −1.84 | 3 | 18 | **0.0015** |
| AK-NEI | 1176 | 47.79% | 46.85% | −0.94 | 13 | 24 | 0.099 |
| ALL | 4101 | 61.98% | 61.40% | −0.59 | 31 | 55 | **0.013** |

**Removing the dense reranker** ($\gamma = 0$):

| Split | $n$ | full | ablated | $\Delta$ | w$\to$r | r$\to$w | $p$ |
| :--- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| AK-Freq | 2108 | 81.83% | 81.02% | −0.81 | 15 | 32 | **0.019** |
| AK-NEF | 817 | 31.21% | 30.23% | −0.98 | 15 | 23 | 0.256 |
| AK-NEI | 1176 | 47.79% | 46.17% | −1.62 | 18 | 37 | **0.015** |
| ALL | 4101 | 61.98% | 60.91% | −1.07 | 48 | 92 | **0.0003** |

Two conclusions:

* The **sparse table does nothing on native words** ($p = 0.851$; the +0.09 is
  noise). Its entire measurable value is named entities. A paper reporting only
  native accuracy cannot justify $10^6$ parameters for it.
* The **dense reranker is real but small**: −1.07pp pooled at $p = 0.0003$.

**They are not independent.** "Remove both" reproduces "remove dense"
*exactly* --- identical accuracies and identical discordant counts on every
split --- because at $\gamma = 0$ the blend returns $-h(D)$ and the sparse
contribution is computed and then discarded. Sparse acts only *through* dense.
Reporting them as two independent contributions would be wrong.

## Components that were removed

Three subsystems were measured, found to contribute nothing, and deleted.

**Corpus-wide SymSpell.** Indexed a romanization of the top 100k corpus words
and scored hits at 850,000 --- above the decoder band. Cost **−30.79pp** native
top-1 (81.74% $\to$ 50.95%), NEI 47.62 $\to$ 25.68, NEF 31.21 $\to$ 20.81. Given
a fair test (distances verified, per-edit penalty) it still cost 9.6pp at a
competing band, and at any safe band produced results *byte-identical* to being
switched off. It never contributed recall at any setting.

**Corpus lexicon.** Dead by construction: the shipped path never loaded one, and
its data file was no longer produced by the pipeline. 0.00pp on every split.

**Lattice CRF and pair model.** 1,518 lines, never constructed, never packed
into the container. The "modified Kneser-Ney" work of an earlier commit had
landed here --- in modules that never shipped.

Total removed: ~1,862 lines, no measurable accuracy change.

## Modified Kneser-Ney against a single discount

Two otherwise-identical 100k runs:

| LM | `AK-Freq` | `AK-NEF` |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| modified KN ($D_1{=}0.605$, $D_2{=}1.036$, $D_3{=}1.444$) | 81.55% / 92.31% | 30.60% / 53.00% |
| fixed $\delta = 0.75$ | 81.26% / 92.22% | 30.84% / 53.86% |

+0.29pp is inside one standard error (0.84pp at $n = 2108$), and fixed $\delta$
is ahead on `AK-NEF`. **Modified Kneser-Ney is now correctly implemented but is
not measurably better than a single discount on this data.** It is retained
because it is the standard estimator and free at runtime; it should not be
described as an improvement.

# Performance

## Where the time goes

Profiled over 1,000 real queries (`examples/profile_decode.rs`, mean input
length 10 characters):

| Phase | ms/query | share |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| free lattice beam | 0.55 | 67% |
| trie-constrained beam | 0.12 | 15% |
| `decode_union` (both + merge) | 0.686 | 84% |
| reranker | 0.047 | 6% |
| engine overhead | 0.082 | 10% |
| **end to end** | **0.816** | |

`make eval-full` reports **0.63--0.72 ms/query** at $k = 10$ over the full test
set, run to run.
Cold start is ~1.5 s.

## How it got there

The engine was at 3.5 ms. Three changes, none of which cost accuracy:

**Binary-search LM lookups (5.4x).** `bigram_weight` and `trigram_weight`
scanned their successor rows linearly. The beam expands ~5,000 hypotheses per
step with one LM lookup each --- roughly 50,000 linear scans per query. Rows are
stored ascending by id, so this is a binary search. Free beam: 3.128 $\to$ 0.575
ms. Output was byte-identical (1944/2108 before and after).

**O(n) beam pruning.** `select_nth_unstable_by` instead of a full sort to keep
the best 64 of ~5,000.

**Lazy arena materialisation.** Path cells are written only for hypotheses that
survive pruning, cutting arena writes from $O(\text{beam} \times \text{edges})$
to $O(\text{beam})$ per step.

**Indexed akshara lookup.** `TranslitModel::akshara_id` was a linear scan over
the vocabulary, called ~500,000 times while building the word trie at start-up.
Cold start: 4.35 $\to$ 1.55 s.

The lesson worth carrying: the reranker was assumed to be the bottleneck and was
6% of the time. **Profile before optimising.**

## Trade-offs available

| Configuration | native top-1 | latency |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| default (beam 64, both passes) | 81.83% | 0.67 ms |
| trie-constrained pass only | 66.18% | 0.18 ms |

Trie-only decoding is 4x faster but costs 15.65pp: the corpus vocabulary does
not cover the test set. Beam width and cascade depth are tunable via
`AKSHAR_BEAM` and `AKSHAR_RERANK_DEPTH`.

\newpage

# Deployment

## Linux / IBus

```sh
make release && sudo make install && make restart-ibus
```

`src/ibus_engine.c` handles key events and the candidate UI, calling the Rust
core through the C ABI in `src/c_api.rs`. The library is installed to
`/usr/lib`, the engine to `/usr/lib/ibus/engines`, the component XML to
`/usr/share/ibus/component`, and the model to `/usr/share/akshar-ime`.

Learned state persists to the user's data directory (`src/persistence.rs`);
`make reset-learning` clears it.

## Browser / WebAssembly

```sh
make wasm            # wasm/pkg + JS wrapper
make wasm-serve      # demo on :8000
```

```js
import { createEngineFromModel } from './akshar.js';
const engine = await createEngineFromModel('/data/akshar_wasm.model');
engine.get_suggestions('namaste', 5);
engine.confirm('namaste', 'नमस्ते');
localStorage.setItem('akshar', engine.export_state());
```

Serve `akshar_wasm.model` with `Content-Encoding: br` and a long cache lifetime;
it is 4.94 MB compressed and immutable.

`WasmEngine::from_bytes(model, lexicon, weights)` retains its `lexicon`
parameter as an ignored no-op so existing callers keep working. Pass `null`.

Browser latency has not been re-measured since 2026-09-06; the last figure was
~3--7 ms per call, taken before the 4.3x decoder speed-up, so it should be
expected to be substantially better.

## Offline tools

| Binary | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `train` | full pipeline, writes the container |
| `pack_model`, `repack_model` | assemble / re-encode a container |
| `prune_lm`, `prune_model`, `quantize_model` | browser-profile compaction |
| `build_wordfreq_text` | vocabulary from running text |
| `romanize` | Devanagari $\to$ Roman with orthographic canonicalisation |
| `probe_model` | inspect container sections, or decode one word |
| `evaluate`, `evaluate_aksharantar`, `evaluate_sentences` | accuracy harnesses |
| `analyze_errors` | oracle curves, taxonomy, collision bound |

`src/fuzzy/grammar.rs` supports `romanize` and `evaluate_sentences` and is not
part of the runtime engine.

# Known defects and limitations

Recorded openly. Nothing here is hidden in a footnote.

## Open defects

**D18 --- the user fuzzy path is unreachable.** A learned word cannot be
recovered from a typo. The path scores $50{,}000 - 12{,}000 d$, i.e. 38,000 at
distance 1, while the decoder's eighth-ranked candidate still scores ~250,000.
Pinned by an `#[ignore]`d test in `tests/fuzzy_behavior.rs`, with a companion
test that fails if the band gap ever closes. **The fix is not a larger constant**
--- that is precisely how the 30.8pp regression happened --- but the log-linear
fusion in §12.

**The trigram's lower-order estimate is wrong** (§6.6). It interpolates against
the highest-order bigram rather than continuation counts.

**There is no end-of-word symbol** (§6.6). Trigram mass is deficient by the
word-final fraction, and the model cannot penalise implausible word endings.

**The candidate-union score space is hand-tuned `u64` bands.** Two of the three
serious defects found in this system originated there. It discards the
reranker's calibration by squashing it through $800{,}000/(1+\text{cost})$.

## Things that do not work as their names suggest

**The discriminative reranker is worse than the heuristic when used alone**
(76.47% against 81.02%). Its net contribution at the tuned blend is +0.81pp on
native words. With ~$10^6$ sparse parameters trained on a candidate-ranking
objective and no regularisation, overfitting is the likely explanation.

**Modified Kneser-Ney is not measurably better than a single discount**
(§9.4).

**Query-variant rewriting contributes 0.00pp** (§9.1). 309 lines of Dijkstra
over a rewrite transducer whose only decoded output is the identity variant.
Retained because it is the only cold-start mechanism for spelling alternation,
but it is not currently earning its place.

## Scope limitations

* **One language.** Trained and measured on Nepali only.
* **One test set.** Aksharantar. The Dakshina benchmark, on which IndicXlit
  reports its headline, is not evaluated.
* **Named entities are well behind** the neural baseline: 31--48% against
  52.67%.
* **The browser profile has not been re-measured** since 2026-09-06.
* **Numbers predate a full retrain.** Every figure was produced with a reranker
  trained on 100k pairs; the first run to use all 3.59M has not yet been made.

\newpage

# Roadmap

The measured decomposition of the 18.2 missing points on native words:

$$
\underbrace{94.3 - 81.8 = 12.5}_{\text{ranking: generated, mis-ranked}}
\;+\;
\underbrace{100 - 94.3 = 5.7}_{\text{generation: never in top 50}}
$$

Work is ordered by expected points per unit of effort.

**1. Factored matra model.** 51.9% of native misses are matra-only, and solving
that class alone reaches 91.03%. This is the largest single lever, and it is a
better-posed problem than whole-word reranking: predict vowel-sign assignment
given a consonant skeleton.

**2. A top-2 discriminator.** Oracle@2 is 89.8%, so 8.0 of the 12.5 ranking
points are a binary choice between the top two candidates. Training a model
specifically on that decision is a smaller and better-conditioned problem than a
50-way ranker.

**3. Log-linear candidate fusion.** Replace the `u64` bands with a single
log-linear score in which every source contributes a feature. This removes an
entire defect class --- both the 30.8pp regression and D18 were band-ordering
bugs --- and makes the sources jointly tunable.

**4. End-of-word symbol.** Cheap, and it targets matra errors, which
concentrate word-finally.

**5. Refit the dense weights.** See §12.3 --- this replaced "retrain the
reranker on more data", which was tested and falsified.

**6. Continuation-count trigram backoff.** Textbook correctness; modest gain.

## Result: more supervision was tested and does not help

The plan above once contained "retrain the reranker on all 3.59M pairs", on the
theory that a 2^20-parameter table trained on 100k examples was starved. That
was run and **falsified**, and the negative result is more useful than the
hypothesis was.

`train-mid` (500,000 reranker pairs --- 5x the released model, with the
corrected learning-rate schedule and held-out early stopping) produced:

| | `AK-Freq` | `AK-NEF` | `AK-NEI` |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| released model (100k pairs) | 81.83% | 31.21% | 47.79% |
| `train-mid` (500k pairs) | 81.59% | 30.97% | 48.30% |

**Five times the ranking supervision changed nothing measurable.** Held-out dev
loss during that run never once beat having no sparse table at all:

| after | dev loss | dev top-1 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| no table (start) | **1.8582** | **54.18%** |
| batch 1 | 1.8785 | 47.23% |
| batch 2 | 1.8719 | 49.07% |
| batch 3 | 1.9192 | 47.82% |
| batch 4 | 1.9208 | 48.08% |
| batch 5 | 1.9182 | 48.67% |

Per-batch training loss on *fresh* data climbed (1.58 $\to$ 1.90 $\to$ 2.46),
which is the generalisation gap stated directly. The learning rate annealed
exactly as designed ($0.05 \times 0.631^{n}$: 0.0500, 0.0315, 0.0199, 0.0126,
0.0079), so this is not a schedule problem.

And the $\gamma$ sweep --- the stated falsification test --- came back unmoved:

| $\gamma$ | released model | `train-mid` |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0.0 (heuristic only) | 81.02% | 80.83% |
| **0.3 (shipped)** | **81.83%** | **81.59%** |
| 0.5 | --- | 81.45% |
| 0.7 | --- | 79.46% |
| 1.0 (learned only) | 76.47% | **74.05%** |

$\gamma$ still peaks at 0.3, and the standalone learned model got *worse* with
more data (76.47% $\to$ 74.05%). **The reranker's problem is not data volume.**

## The likely cause, and the corrected next step

`W_DENSE` --- the 29 dense weights --- **has never been retrained by this
pipeline.** `train.rs` imports it as a frozen constant and fits only the sparse
table; the generator named in `reranker_weights.rs` does not exist in the
repository. The v5 container now carries fresh $\mu$ and $\sigma$ so the
features are standardised against the current model, but the *weights applied to
them* still come from some earlier, lost training run.

So what the system calls "the learned model" is stale dense weights plus a
freshly-trained sparse table, and it is unsurprising that the combination loses
to a three-parameter heuristic. Adding sparse capacity on top of misfitted dense
weights cannot fix that, which is what the two experiments above measured.

The corrected step is to **fit the dense weights and the sparse table jointly**
against the current EM/LM output, under the same softmax objective, with L2
regularisation and the held-out early stopping that already exists. Only after
that is a full 3.59M run worth its four hours.

## What would falsify the remaining plan

* If a re-measured oracle@50 falls materially below 94.3%, the
  ranking/generation split is wrong and generation work should take priority.
* If jointly refitting the dense weights still leaves $\gamma$ peaked at 0.3,
  the feature set --- not the fitting --- is the limit, and the discriminative
  stage should be replaced rather than repaired.

# Experimental record

Final numbers cannot show what was tried and rejected. The working documents in
`docs/plans/archive/` preserve that record; this chapter summarises it.

**The accuracy figures in the archive are historical** --- measured before the
2026-09-06 defect fixes --- and do not describe the shipped system. This manual
is authoritative for current numbers.

## Approaches evaluated and rejected

| Approach | Why rejected |
| :--- | :--- |
| IndicXlit transformer (~11M params) as the core | ~40 MB; breaks the browser budget by an order of magnitude. Retained only as an offline reference point. |
| NADIR-style non-autoregressive neural decoder | ~50 MB; same constraint. |
| Neural character LM interpolated with the KN LM | 5--10 MB for $< 1$pp on the tail. |
| Corpus word-bigram context table | 19.5 MB of container for +0.16pp. Removed in container v4. |
| Corpus-wide fuzzy matching | Cost 30.79pp of native top-1 and contributed no recall at any score band (§9.5). Removed. |
| Corpus roman$\to$devanagari lexicon | 0.00pp on every stratum; dead by construction. Removed. |
| Lattice CRF over the decode graph | Half-built, never wired in, 702 lines. Removed rather than left as dead weight; recoverable from git. |
| Joint pair-model over (akshara, chunk) states | Built by the trainer but never packed or loaded. Removed. |
| Modified Kneser-Ney over a single discount | Implemented correctly, but +0.29pp is inside one standard error (§9.4). Retained as the standard estimator, not claimed as an improvement. |
| More reranker supervision (5x) | Tested at 500k pairs; changed nothing, and dev loss never beat having no sparse table (§13.2). |

## Approaches considered but not implemented

Recorded in `docs/plans/archive/2026-09-05-research-agenda.md`:

* **Context-tree weighting** [Willems, Shtarkov & Tjalkens 1995] as a
  parameter-free alternative to Kneser-Ney smoothing.
* **A\* anytime decoding** [Hart, Nilsson & Raphael 1968] over the lattice, for
  exact search with a latency budget.
* **An entropy harness** to measure the information budget --- how many bits the
  Roman input actually carries about the Devanagari output --- and thus bound
  what any model can achieve.
* **Incremental decoding**: caching the beam per prefix and extending it by one
  character, rather than re-decoding the whole growing prefix on each keystroke.

# Glossary

Every term this manual uses in a technical sense. Where a term is due to a
particular author, the reference is given.

**Abugida** --- a writing system in which each consonant carries an inherent
vowel that a diacritic modifies or suppresses [Daniels 1990]. Devanagari is one;
this is why characters are the wrong modelling unit and aksharas are the right
one.

**Akshara** --- the orthographic syllable of Brahmic scripts, and the unit this
system models. Formally
$(\text{consonant}\ \text{halanta})^{*}\ \text{consonant}?\ (\text{matra} \mid \text{independent vowel})\ (\text{nasal} \mid \text{visarga})^{*}$.

**Anusvara** (`ं`) --- a diacritic marking nasalisation. Frequently omitted or
inserted inconsistently in Roman input, and a common source of matra-only errors.

**Backoff** --- in an $n$-gram model, falling back to a shorter context when the
full context was unseen, paying a weight $-\log\lambda$ for doing so.

**Beam search** --- approximate search that keeps only the $b$ best partial
hypotheses at each step [Lowerre 1976]. Here $b = 64$ by default.

**Bootstrap confidence interval** --- an interval obtained by resampling the
observed per-case outcomes with replacement and taking percentiles of the
resulting statistic [Efron 1979].

**CER (character error rate)** --- total Levenshtein distance between prediction
and gold, divided by total gold length. A graded alternative to exact match.

**Chandrabindu** (`ँ`) --- a nasalisation diacritic distinct from anusvara.

**Chunk** --- a contiguous run of 0--5 Roman characters emitted by one akshara.
The empty chunk is how the model represents a dropped inherent vowel.

**Codebook quantisation** --- storing weights as 8-bit indices into a
256-entry table of `f32` values, rather than as full floats.

**Collision bound** --- the accuracy ceiling for any system whose only prior is
corpus unigram frequency; 99.15% here. Distinguishes "the model is weak" from
"the task is ambiguous".

**Conjunct** --- two or more consonants joined by a halanta into one visual and
orthographic unit, e.g. `क्ष`. Segmented as a single akshara.

**Continuation probability** --- in Kneser-Ney smoothing, a lower-order estimate
based on the number of *distinct contexts* a token appears in rather than its
raw frequency [Kneser & Ney 1995]. The reason *Kong* is a poor guess in a novel
context despite being frequent.

**CSR (compressed sparse row)** --- storing a ragged 2-D structure as one flat
value array plus row offsets.

**Damerau-Levenshtein distance** --- edit distance allowing insertion, deletion,
substitution and transposition [Damerau 1964; Levenshtein 1966].

**Delta varint encoding** --- storing an ascending integer sequence as
variable-length gaps rather than absolute values. Requires and preserves sorted
order, which is also what makes binary search valid at runtime.

**Discount ($D_i$)** --- the mass subtracted from an $n$-gram's count before
normalising, and redistributed to unseen events. Modified Kneser-Ney uses three,
selected by count, each constrained to $0 \le D_i \le i$ [Chen & Goodman 1999].

**Emission** --- $P(\text{chunk} \mid \text{akshara})$, the channel model learned
by EM.

**EM (expectation-maximisation)** --- iterative maximum-likelihood estimation
with latent variables [Dempster, Laird & Rubin 1977]; here the latent variable is
the alignment between Roman chunks and aksharas.

**Forward-backward** --- the dynamic program computing posterior occupancy in a
chain model [Baum et al. 1970]; the E-step of EM here.

**Front coding** --- dictionary compression storing each entry as a shared-prefix
length plus a suffix.

**Halanta / virama** (`्`) --- the vowel-killer diacritic. Suppresses a
consonant's inherent vowel and binds it to the next consonant.

**Hashing trick** --- mapping an unbounded feature space into a fixed-size table
by hashing, accepting collisions in exchange for a bounded memory budget
[Weinberger et al. 2009].

**Inherent vowel / schwa** --- the vowel a bare Devanagari consonant carries
(`क` = *ka*, not *k*). Written or omitted at the typist's discretion, which is a
major source of alignment ambiguity.

**Lattice** --- a DAG whose nodes are input positions and whose edges are
labelled hypotheses. Decoding is shortest-path over it.

**Matra** --- a dependent vowel sign attached to a consonant (`ा`, `ि`, `ी`, …).
**51.9% of this system's native errors are matra-only.**

**McNemar's test** --- a paired significance test for two classifiers on the same
cases, using only the discordant pairs [McNemar 1947].

**MRR (mean reciprocal rank)** --- the mean of $1/\mathrm{rank}$ of the gold
answer, 0 when absent. Sensitive to position, not just presence.

**Multi-reference** --- scoring against any of several acceptable romanizations,
rather than a single reference.

**NFC** --- Unicode Normalization Form C (canonical composition). All string
comparison here is on NFC-normalised text.

**Oracle@$k$** --- the accuracy a perfect reranker would reach on the candidates
actually generated. Separates ranking loss from generation loss.

**Purnabiram** (`।`) --- the Devanagari full stop.

**Semiring, tropical** --- $(\min, +)$ arithmetic on negative log probabilities
[Mohri 1997]. Converts maximum-probability search into shortest-path search, and
is why all weights in this system add.

**Source-channel model** --- factoring $P(D \mid R) \propto P(R \mid D)P(D)$ into
a channel and a source [Shannon 1948]; applied to transliteration by
[Li, Zhang & Su 2004].

**SymSpell** --- spelling correction by precomputed deletion variants, giving
lookup independent of dictionary size [Garbe]. A delete-set match is a
*necessary* condition only, so results must be distance-verified.

**Top-$k$ accuracy** --- the fraction of cases whose gold string appears in the
first $k$ suggestions, by exact match.

**Trie** --- a prefix tree [Fredkin 1960]. Used for the user dictionary and for
the vocabulary-constrained decode pass.

**Virama** --- see *halanta*.

**Visarga** (`ः`) --- a diacritic representing a final voiceless breath.

**Welford's algorithm** --- numerically stable online computation of mean and
variance [Welford 1962].

**ZWJ / ZWNJ** --- zero-width joiner and non-joiner (U+200D, U+200C). Preserved
next to viramas so Nepali eyelash-ra (`र्‍`) keeps its form.
