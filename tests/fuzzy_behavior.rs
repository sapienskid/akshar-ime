//! What the fuzzy path does after the 2026-09-06 removal of the corpus-wide
//! SymSpell source.
//!
//! Two sources of typo tolerance remain, and they are deliberately different:
//!
//!   1. `expand_query_variants` (`normalizer.rs`) rewrites the *query* before
//!      decoding — vowel-length alternations (`ee->ii`, `oo->uu`), v/w, and
//!      separators. This is cold-start: it needs no learning, applies to every
//!      user, and feeds the decoder a principled cost per rewrite.
//!
//!   2. The user SymSpell (`engine.symspell`) covers arbitrary edits within
//!      distance 2, but only over words the user has confirmed. Every hit is
//!      distance-verified against the stored roman variants before it scores.
//!
//! The removed third source indexed a romanization of the top 100k corpus
//! words and returned unverified delete-set intersections above the decoder's
//! band. These tests pin the behaviour of what replaced it.
