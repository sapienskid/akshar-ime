# Akshar Devanagari IME

Roman-script input method for Devanagari, targeted at Nepali. You type
`namaste`, it offers `नमस्ते`.

**No neural network at runtime.** An EM-trained source-channel model over
orthographic syllables, a modified Kneser-Ney syllable language model, and a
linear discriminative reranker. Inference is beam search plus dot products —
no tensor library, no GPU.

**11.37 MB desktop, 4.94 MB Brotli in the browser. 0.67 ms per query.**

## What contributes what

Measured by ablation, reproducible from the shipped binary (`make ablate`):

| Ranking stage | `AK-Freq` top-1 | Δ |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| raw decoder order (`emit + lm`) | 75.38% | — |
| + frequency heuristic | 81.02% | **+5.64** |
| + 29 dense features | 81.93% | +0.91 |
| + 2²⁰ sparse table (shipped) | 81.83% | −0.10 |

Removing the trigram language model costs **−3.89pp**; it is the single largest
component. See the manual for per-stratum numbers with McNemar p-values.

## Measured performance

Held-out AI4Bharat Aksharantar Nepali test split (4,101 cases), measured
2026-09-06 on `data/akshar.model` at default settings.

| Split | n | top-1 | top-5 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `AK-Freq` (native words) | 2,108 | **81.83%** | 92.22% |
| `AK-NEI` (named entities) | 1,176 | 47.79% | 69.81% |
| `AK-NEF` (named entities) | 817 | 31.21% | 53.00% |
| All cases | 4,101 | 61.98% | 77.98% |

Pooled top-1 bootstrap 95% CI [60.61%, 63.36%]; MRR 0.6906; CER on `AK-Freq`
top-1 is 3.90%. For reference, IndicXlit (an ~11M-parameter transformer) reports
80.25% top-1 on the native split and 52.67% on named entities — native accuracy
here is comparable, named-entity accuracy is well behind.

## Documentation

**[`docs/MANUAL.md`](docs/MANUAL.md)** — the complete reference, 52 pages.
Build a PDF with `make manual`.

| Part | Contents |
| :--- | :--- |
| Theory | source-channel formulation, akshara segmentation, EM with scaled forward–backward, modified Kneser-Ney, decoding, discriminative reranking |
| Implementation | module map, container format, performance engineering |
| Practice | training pipeline, **evaluation methodology**, ablations with McNemar significance, deployment |
| Status | known defects, experimental record, roadmap |

Every metric is defined formally, every technique is credited to its authors,
and every term is in the glossary. Threats to validity are stated explicitly.

`docs/plans/` holds the live defect register and roadmap;
`docs/plans/archive/` preserves the experiment log, literature review and
research agenda from development — what was tried and rejected, not just what
shipped.

## Quick start

```sh
make release            # build
sudo make install       # install to IBus
make restart-ibus       # NOT as root
```

```rust
use akshar_ime::ImeEngine;
let mut engine = ImeEngine::new();
let suggestions = engine.get_suggestions("namaste", 5);
engine.user_confirms("namaste", "नमस्ते");   // adaptive learning
```

Browser: `make wasm-serve`, then see the manual's deployment chapter.

## Reproducing the numbers

```sh
make test          # tests, including the accuracy regression guard
make eval          # accuracy by split
make eval-full     # bootstrap CIs, MRR, per-query latency
make eval-errors   # oracle curves, error taxonomy, CER, collision bound
make ablate        # component contributions
```

Training (`make train-mid`, `make train-full`) is documented in the manual.
Note that `--reranker-pairs` sizes the reranker's training set only — the EM
model and language model always use all 3.59M pairs.

## Honest limitations

- One language (Nepali), one test set (Aksharantar).
- Named entities are well behind the neural baseline.
- Reranking is worth +6.45pp overall, but **87% of that is a 3-parameter
  frequency heuristic** — the 10⁶-parameter learned stage adds +0.91pp, and its
  sparse half adds nothing on native words (p = 0.851).
- 5x more reranker training data was tested and changed nothing; the cause is
  that `W_DENSE` has never been refit by this pipeline (manual §12.3).

Manual chapter 11 lists every known defect.
